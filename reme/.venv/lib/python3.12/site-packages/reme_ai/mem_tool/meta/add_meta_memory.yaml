tool: |
  Add a memory metadata entry to register a new memory type and target.
  Use this tool to define what types of memories should be tracked, such as:
  - Personal memories: "John", "Alice" (person-specific preferences and context)
  - Procedural memories: "deployment_process", "code_review_steps" (how-to knowledge)

tool_multiple: |
  Add multiple memory metadata entries to register multiple memory types and targets at once.
  Use this tool to define multiple memory tracking categories in a single operation.
  Each entry specifies a memory_type and memory_target for organizing different memory domains.

meta_memories: |
  A list of memory metadata entries to add. Each entry contains memory_type and memory_target.

memory_type: |
  The type of memory to register. Valid values are: personal, procedural.
  - personal: Person-specific memory storing preferences and context about specific individuals
  - procedural: Procedural memory storing how-to knowledge and step-by-step processes

memory_target: |
  The target identifier for this memory category.
  Examples:
  - For personal memory: person's name (e.g., "John", "Alice")
  - For procedural memory: domain or topic name (e.g., "deployment", "code_review")
