  Add a summary memory to the vector store for future retrieval.
  Use this tool to store a summarized version of the provided context.
  The LLM should first summarize the context, then call this tool with the summarized content.

  This tool is specifically designed for storing summaries of conversations, events, or information
  that has been condensed from a larger context. Examples:
  - Summarizing a long conversation: "User discussed project requirements for a web app with authentication"
  - Summarizing a decision: "Team decided to use PostgreSQL for the database after evaluating options"
  - Summarizing an event: "Successfully deployed version 2.0 to production with new features"

summary_memory: |
  The summarized content to store as memory.
  Should be a clear, concise summary that captures the key information from the context.
  Keep it focused and informative - aim for 1-3 sentences that convey the essential points.
  Examples:
  - "User prefers Python for backend development and has experience with FastAPI framework"
  - "Project deadline is January 15th, requires authentication, payment integration, and admin dashboard"
  - "Bug in user registration was caused by missing email validation, fixed by adding regex check"
