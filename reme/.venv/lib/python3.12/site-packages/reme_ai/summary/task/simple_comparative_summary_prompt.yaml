  # Execution Process B
  {execution_process_b}

  # Task
  **Execution Process A** and **Execution Process B** represent two distinct execution trajectories of two agents, with Execution Process A being superior to Execution Process B.
  Analyze these two trajectories and identify areas where Execution Process B can be improved relative to Execution Process A.
  The insights derived should be generalizable, offering guidance for solving similar problems in the future.
  These insights can include positive recommendations or point out pitfalls to avoid.
  The format of the insights can be plain text or a snippet of code addressing a specific issue.
  If no insights can be derived, return an empty list [].
  For each insight, first specify the context in which it applies (when to use), followed by the insight itself. Provide up to two insights.
