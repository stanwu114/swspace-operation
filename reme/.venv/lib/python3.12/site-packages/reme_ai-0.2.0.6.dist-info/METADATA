              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  <strong>Memory Management Kit for Agents, Remember Me, Refine Me.</strong><br>
  <em><sub>If you find it useful, please give us a ⭐ Star.</sub></em>
</p>

---

ReMe is a **modular memory management kit** that provides AI agents with unified memory capabilities—enabling the ability to extract, reuse, and share memories across users, tasks, and agents.
Agent memory can be viewed as:

```text
Agent Memory = Long-Term Memory + Short-Term Memory
             = (Personal + Task + Tool) Memory + (Working Memory)
```

- **Personal Memory**: Understand user preferences and adapt to context
- **Task Memory**: Learn from experience and perform better on similar tasks
- **Tool Memory**: Optimize tool selection and parameter usage based on historical performance
- **Working Memory**: Manage short-term context for long-running agents without context overflow

---

## ✨ Architecture Design

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/_static/figure/reme_structure.jpg" alt="ReMe Architecture" width="80%">
</p>

ReMe provides a **modular memory management kit** with pluggable components that can be integrated into any agent framework. The system consists of:

#### 🧠 **Task Memory/Experience**

Procedural knowledge reused across agents

- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify effective strategies and understand their underlying principles
- **Failure Analysis Learning**: Learn from mistakes and avoid repeating the same issues
- **Comparative Patterns**: Different sampling trajectories provide more valuable memories through comparison
- **Validation Patterns**: Confirm the effectiveness of extracted memories through validation modules

Learn more about how to use task memory from [task memory](docs/task_memory/task_memory.md)

#### 👤 **Personal Memory**

Contextualized memory for specific users

- **Individual Preferences**: User habits, preferences, and interaction styles
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Intelligent memory management based on time and context
- **Progressive Learning**: Gradually build deep understanding through long-term interaction
- **Time Awareness**: Time sensitivity in both retrieval and integration

Learn more about how to use personal memory from [personal memory](docs/personal_memory/personal_memory.md)

#### 🔧 **Tool Memory**

Data-driven tool selection and usage optimization

- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Success rates, execution times, and token costs from real usage
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: Qualitative insights on why tools succeed or fail
- **Parameter Optimization**: Learn optimal parameter configurations from successful calls
- **Dynamic Guidelines**: Transform static tool descriptions into living, learned manuals

Learn more about how to use tool memory from [tool memory](docs/tool_memory/tool_memory.md)

#### 🧠 Working Memory

Short‑term contextual memory for long‑running agents via **message offload & reload**:
- **Message Offload**: Compact large tool outputs to external files or LLM summaries
- **Message Reload**: Search (`grep_working_memory`) and read (`read_working_memory`) offloaded content on demand
📖 **Concept & API**:
- Message offload overview: [Message Offload](docs/work_memory/message_offload.md)
- Offload / reload operators: [Message Offload Ops](docs/work_memory/message_offload_ops.md), [Message Reload Ops](docs/work_memory/message_reload_ops.md)

## 📦 Pre-built Memory Library

ReMe provides a **memory library** with pre-extracted, production-ready memories that agents can load and use immediately:

### Available Memory Packs

| Memory Pack          | Domain         | Size          | Description                                                                         |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`appworld.jsonl`** | Task Execution | ~100 memories | Complex task planning patterns, multi-step workflows, and error recovery strategies |
| **`bfcl_v3.jsonl`**  | Tool Usage     | ~150 memories | Function calling patterns, parameter optimization, and tool selection strategies    |

### Loading Pre-built Memories

```python
# Load pre-built memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/vector_store", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "action": "load",
    "path": "./docs/library/"
})

# Query relevant memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/retrieve_task_memory", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "query": "How to navigate to settings and update user profile?",
    "top_k": 1
})
```

<details>
<summary>Python import version</summary>

## 🧪 Experiments

### 🌍 [Appworld Experiment](docs/cookbook/appworld/quickstart.md)

We tested ReMe on Appworld using Qwen3-8B (non-thinking mode):

| Method       | Avg@4               | Pass@4              |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.1497              | 0.3285              |
| with ReMe    | 0.1706 **(+2.09%)** | 0.3631 **(+3.46%)** |

Pass@K measures the probability that at least one of the K generated samples successfully completes the task (
score=1).
The current experiment uses an internal AppWorld environment, which may have slight differences.

You can find more details on reproducing the experiment in [quickstart.md](docs/cookbook/appworld/quickstart.md).

### 🔧 [BFCL-V3 Experiment](docs/cookbook/bfcl/quickstart.md)

We tested ReMe on BFCL-V3 multi-turn-base (randomly split 50train/150val) using Qwen3-8B (thinking mode):

| Method       | Avg@4               | Pass@4              |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.4033              | 0.5955              |

We tested on 100 random frozenlake maps using qwen3-8b:

| Method       | pass rate        |
|--------------|------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.66             |
| with ReMe    | 0.72 **(+6.0%)** |

You can find more details on reproducing the experiment in [quickstart.md](docs/cookbook/frozenlake/quickstart.md).

### 🛠️ [Tool Memory Benchmark](docs/tool_memory/tool_bench.md)

We evaluated Tool Memory effectiveness using a controlled benchmark with three mock search tools using Qwen3-30B-Instruct:

| Scenario               | Avg Score | Improvement |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Train (No Memory)      | 0.650     | -           |
| Test (No Memory)       | 0.672     | Baseline    |
| **Test (With Memory)** | **0.772** | **+14.88%** |

**Key Findings:**
- Tool Memory enables data-driven tool selection based on historical performance
- Success rates improved by ~15% with learned parameter configurations

You can find more details in [tool_bench.md](docs/tool_memory/tool_bench.md) and the implementation at [run_reme_tool_bench.py](cookbook/tool_memory/run_reme_tool_bench.py).
