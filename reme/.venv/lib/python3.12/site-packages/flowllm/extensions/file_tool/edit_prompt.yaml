tool_desc: |
  Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when \`expected_replacements\` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the ${READ_FILE_TOOL_NAME} tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.
  The user has the ability to modify the \`new_string\` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.
  Expectation for required parameters:
  1. \`file_path\` is the path to the file to modify.
  2. \`old_string\` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).
  3. \`new_string\` MUST be the exact literal text to replace \`old_string\` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic.
  4. NEVER escape \`old_string\` or \`new_string\`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.
  **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for \`old_string\`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.
  **Multiple replacements:** Set \`expected_replacements\` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match \`old_string\` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.

file_path: |
  The path to the file to modify.

old_string: |
  The exact literal text to replace, preferably unescaped. For single replacements (default), include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. For multiple replacements, specify expected_replacements parameter. If this string is not the exact literal text (i.e. you escaped it) or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.

new_string: |
  The exact literal text to replace `old_string` with, preferably unescaped. Provide the EXACT text. Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic.

expected_replacements: |
  Optional: Number of replacements expected. Defaults to 1 if not specified. Use when you want to replace multiple occurrences.
